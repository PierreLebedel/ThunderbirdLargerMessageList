# Thunderbird Larger Message List
Thunderbird 78+ extension that enlarges the display of the message list, and spaces the folder tree view.

The coloring of the software elements (determined by your system settings and your active Thunderbird theme) is not affected by this add-on. Only the size of the lines is enlarged.
